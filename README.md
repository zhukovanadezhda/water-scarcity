# 🚱 Water Shortage Prediction at Hi!ckathon 2024

## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains the work developed by our team for the [Hi!ckathon](https://www.hi-paris.fr/hickathon/), a competition focused on AI and sustainability organized by Hi! PARIS - the Center on Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence for Science, Business and Society created by Institut Polytechnique de Paris and HEC Paris and joined by Centre Inria de Saclay. The goal of our project was to build an AI model capable of predicting groundwater levels for French piezometric stations, with a special emphasis on the summer months. Our model uses a variety of data sources, including piezometric data, weather patterns, hydrology, water withdrawal, and economic data, to make accurate predictions. 

In addition to model development, we were tasked with considering the real-world application of our solution and projecting how it could be used in the market to address water shortages 🌍💧

## 🚀 Objective
The primary objective of the project is to:
- Build a predictive model for forecasting groundwater levels at French piezometric stations.
- Focus specifically on the summer months, as they are crucial for water resource management.
- Leverage multiple data sources, including weather, hydrology, water withdrawal, and economic data, to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore and design a real-world application of the model to address water shortage issues.
